# Random-Numbers-Program
The number of integers to randomly generate will be specified as a command line argument from the user. The generated integers are stored in an array so that they can be manipulated later. The program prints out the randomly generated numbers, each on its own line. The program also creates a String that specifies the number of even numbers generated and the average of the numbers generated. That String is printed to System.out. 

For example, if the user entered “4” as a command line argument and the numbers 8, 110, 324, and 95 were generated, the following would be printed to System.out: 8 110 324 95 Even: 3 Avg: 134.25
